Next Steps:
    Plan out the visuals once you're inside the app (tabs, features, etc.)
    
    Home Tab:
        -Shows previous workout
        -Calendar which shows the current month and highlights the days that a workout has been logged
        -Button which when clicked leads to a new view where you track your workout
        -Button to see profile and settings
        -(brainstorm more ideas)
        
    Workout View:
        -Used to log a new workout
        -Flowchart
            -New Workout
                -New Exercise - (click exercise)
                    -Set 1 - Weight - Reps
                    -New Set Button
                
                -New Exercise Button moves down
                
            -Save workout (Add a confirmation message because you can't change after you save)
            
    
    Workout History Tab:
        -Allows you to see all of your workouts (will have to figure out design later)
    
    
    Progression/Stats Tab:
        Pie Chart of sets spent on each muscle group
        Pie Chart of rep ranges (0 - 3, 4 - 7, 8 - 12, 13+)
        
        Choose an exercise and get shown:
            -Graph (time vs weight (shows set with highest weight from the exercise))
            -Average working weight over the last month and shows comparison to previous month
            -Average working reps over the last month (no comparison - to each their own imo)
            -(might add more later)
        
        
    Work on improving visuals for:
        -LoginView
        -RegisterView
    

Plan:
    -Add a welcome message to WelcomeView
    -Make LoginView and RegisterView more visually appealing
    
    -Work on the visuals for WorkoutView so that you can actually make a workout (doesn't need to save yet)
